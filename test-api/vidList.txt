Challenges of Global Poverty | MITx on edX | About Video (Feb 2015)
The Challenges of Global Poverty A course for those who are interested in the challenge posed by massive and persistent world poverty. Register for The Challenges of Global Poverty from MITx at http://edx.org/courses About this Course This is a course for those who are interested in the challenge posed by massive and persistent world poverty, and are hopeful that economists might have something useful to say about this challenge. The questions we will take up include: Is extreme poverty a thing of the past? What is economic life like when living under a dollar per day? Are the poor always hungry? How do we make schools work for poor citizens? How do we deal with the disease burden? Is microfinance invaluable or overrated? Without property rights, is life destined to be "nasty, brutish and short"? Should we leave economic development to the market? Should we leave economic development to non-governmental organizations (NGOs)? Does foreign aid help or hinder? Where is the best place to intervene? And many others. At the end of this course, you should have a good sense of the key questions asked by scholars interested in poverty today, and hopefully a few answers as well.
Intro to Computer Science & Programming Using Python: 6.00.1x | MITx on edX | About Video
6.00.1x is an Introduction to computer science as a tool to solve real-world analytical problems. Register for Introduction to Computer Science & Programming Using Python at http://edx.org/courses. ABOUT THIS COURSE This course is the first of a two-course sequence: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python, and Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science. Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. Some of the people taking the two courses will use them as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many it will be their first and last computer science courses. Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are not "computation appreciation" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will. Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python covers the notion of computation, the Python programming language, some simple algorithms, testing and debugging, and informal introduction to algorithmic complexity, and some simple algorithms and data structures.

MITx: A Global History of Architecture: Part 1: 4 605x About Video
This course is a history of architecture from a global perspective. Sign up for A Global History of Architecture Part 1, as well as other edX courses at http://edx.org. About This Course: How do we understand architecture? One way of answering this question is by looking through the lens of history. This course will examine architecture through time, beginning with First Societies and extending to the 15th century. Though the course is chronological, it is not intended as a linear narrative, but rather aims to provide a more global view, by focusing on different architectural "moments." The lectures will give students the appropriate grounding for understanding a range of buildings and contexts. The material in the lectures will be supplemented by readings from the textbook A Global History of Architecture. Each lecture analyzes a particular architectural transformation arising from a dynamic cultural situation. How did the introduction of iron in the ninth century BCE impact regional politics and the development of architecture? How did new religious formations, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, produce new architectural understandings? What were the architectural consequences of the changing political landscape in northern Italy in the 14th century? How did rock-cut architecture move across space and time from West Asia to India to Africa? How did the emergence of corn impact the rise of religious and temple construction in Mexico? These are typical questions that the lectures will address.

Underactuated Robotics | MITx on edX | Course About Video
Underactuated Robotics Algorithms for Walking, Running, Swimming, Flying, and Manipulation About this Course Robots today move far too conservatively, using control systems that attempt to maintain full control authority at all times. Humans and animals move much more aggressively by routinely executing motions which involve a loss of instantaneous control authority. Controlling nonlinear systems without complete control authority requires methods that can reason about and exploit the natural dynamics of our machines. This course introduces nonlinear dynamics and control of underactuated mechanical systems, with an emphasis on computational methods. Topics include the nonlinear dynamics of robotic manipulators, applied optimal and robust control and motion planning. Discussions include examples from biology and applications to legged locomotion, compliant manipulation, underwater robots, and flying machines.
Street Fighting Math | MITx on edX | About Page
Street-Fighting Math Teaches, as the antidote to rigor mortis, the art of educated guessing and opportunistic problem solving. Register for Street Fighting Math from MIT at http://www.edx.org/courses. About this Course Too much mathematical rigor teaches rigor mortis: the fear of making an unjustified leap even when it lands on a correct result. Instead of paralysis, have courage: Shoot first and ask questions later. Although unwise as public policy, it is a valuable problem-solving philosophy and the theme of this course: how to guess answers without a proof or an exact calculation, in order to develop insight. You will learn this skill by mastering six reasoning tools---dimensional analysis, easy cases, lumping, pictorial reasoning, taking out the big part, and analogy. The applications will include mental calculation, estimating population growth rates, understanding drag without differential equations, singing musical intervals to estimate logarithms, approximating integrals, summing infinite series, and turning differential equations into algebra. Your learning will be supported by regular readings that you discuss with other students, by short tablet videos, by quick problems to help you check your understanding, by weekly homework problems, review and and a final exam. You will work hard, and, by the end of the course, have learned a rough-and-ready approach to using mathematics to understand the world. All required readings are available within the courseware, courtesy of The MIT Press. A print version of the course textbook, Street-Fighting Math, is also available for purchase. The MIT Press is offering enrolled students a special 30% discount on books ordered directly through the publisher's website.

Introduction to Philosophy: God, Knowledge and Consciousness This course will focus on big questions. You will learn how to ask them and how to answer them. Register for Introduction to Philosophy: God, Knowledge and Consciousness from MIT at https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-24-00x-introduction-philosophy-god-2481 About this Course This course has two goals. The first is to introduce you to the things that philosophers think about. We will look at some perennial philosophical problems: Is there a God? What is knowledge, and how do we get it? What is the place of our consciousness in the physical world? Do we have free will? How do we persist over time, as our bodily and psychological traits change? The second goal is to get you thinking philosophically yourself. This will help you develop your critical reasoning and argumentative skills more generally. Along the way we will draw from late, great classical authors and influential contemporary figures. If you wish to take the course as a 'verified' student (technological checks guarantee it is you taking the course) then please register as Verified below. It will cost you $50. Upon completing the course you will receive a certificate that says that you completed the course as a 'verified' student. Otherwise you can take the course as a non-verified student (you guarantee it is you taking the course by signing an honor code) for free. You will receive a certificate that says that you completed the course as a non-verified student. Next Spring (2015) we will be offering 24.118x Paradox and Infinity for the first time. Next Fall (2015) we will be offering 24.09x Minds and Machines for the first time. By completing all three courses as a verified student you will be eligible for a Philosophy X series certificate.

Design and Development of Educational Technology | MITx on edX | About Video
Design and Development of Educational Technology Enroll at: https://www.edx.org/course/design-development-educational-mitx-11-132x This project-based course explores educational technologies and the theories underlying their development through interviews with experts in the field. Register for Design and Development of Educational Technology at http://ow.ly/zyrPD About this Course To be effective, educational technologies must be designed based on what we know about how people learn. Through interviews with multiple experts in the field, this course examines educational technologies, outlines the theories that influenced their development, and examines their use. The course leads up to a final project  a kickstarter style pitch for a new educational technology - which is worked on iteratively across the weeks. It involves active weekly participation. In week 1, well talk about the history of educational technologies and how they change the way we learn. Well also discuss two important educational theories that focus on student-centered learning. In week 2, well explore what it means to learn something and examine several different approaches to deepen learning. Well begin by introducing a specific framework for thinking about learning. Well then take a close look at how educational software developers are more deeply engaging learners and even providing feedback to students as they learn. Week 3 will focus on forms of Active Learning, where students choose and pursue activities based on their own interests. Well also talk with experts about designing to help build important non-cognitive skills, like persistence and developing mastery. Week 4 will move from individual learning to collaborative learning in a range of forms, from apprenticeships to communities of practice. Well speak with experts about the many ways learning in groups can manifest itself. No matter what the medium, collaborative learning has a lot to teach us. Week 5 focuses on assessment. All the clever educational technology design in the world isnt very useful if we dont know whether students learning is being enhanced by it or what changes need to be made to increase its effectiveness. Well talk with teachers, students, and assessment experts who will provide an overview of the different types of assessment and how technology is changing the field of assessment. Finally, in week 6, well talk about design-based research, a methodology for research and design of educational innovations in which you create projects that embody the educational change you wish to study. Week 0 of this course is a 'ramp-up' week for participants to introduce themselves to one another and become familiar with the forums and other course platform features. This course is part of the EdTechX series from the MIT Education Arcade. Build your understanding of the use and design of technologies for learning. Check out the other course modules.

Innovation and Commercialization | MIT on edX | About Video
Covering from human process of innovating to innovation ecosystems. Register for Innovation and Commercialization and other edx Courses at http://edx.org/courses. Innovation and Commercialization is taught by distinguished practicing innovators. They debunk the concept of innovation as a linear process, from research to development to product in the market. They present a simple model for understanding it as a highly iterative process, in which you cycle repeatedly through many factors in the areas of Technology, Market and Implementation -- until the right pieces come together. Prof. Fitzgerald tells the story of his own major innovation, tracing it along the winding path into products we use every day. The course then proceeds to tell the larger story of how the vaunted American 'pipeline' for carrying this process has been pulled apart. Register at http://edx.org/courses.
MITx: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming: 6.00x About Video
6.00x is an Introduction to computer science as a tool to solve real-world analytical problems. You can register for Introduction to Computer Science and Programming, as well as other edX courses at http://edx.org/courses. 6.00x is an introduction to using computation to solve real problems. The course is aimed at students with little or no prior programming experience who have a desire (or at least a need) to understand computational approaches to problem solving. Some of the people taking the course will use it as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many, it will be their first and last computer science course. Since the course will be the only formal computer science course many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career.

Visualizing Japan | HarvardX & MITx on edX | About Video
Visualizing Japan (1850s-1930s): Westernization, Protest, Modernity A first-time MITx/HarvardX collaboration, VJx opens windows on Japan's transition into the modern world through the historical visual record. Register for Visualizing Japan from Harvard and MIT at https://www.edx.org/courses. About this Course This co-taught course looks at Japanese history and the skills and questions involved in reading history through images now accessible in digital formats. The course is based on the MIT "Visualizing Cultures" website devoted to image-driven research on Japan and China since the 19th century (visualizingcultures.mit.edu). The introductory module considers methodologies historians use to "visualize" the past, followed by three modules that explore the themes of Westernization, in Commodore Perry's 1853-54 expedition to Japan; social protest, in Tokyo's 1905 Hibiya Riot; and modernity, as seen in the archives of the major Japanese cosmetics company, Shiseido. Module 0: Introduction: New Historical Sources for a Digital Age (Professors Dower, Gordon, Miyagawa). Digitization has dramatically altered historians' access to primary sources, making large databases of the visual record readily accessible. How is historical methodology changing in response to this seismic shift? How can scholars, students, and the general public make optimal use of these new digital resources? Module 1: Black Ships & Samurai (Professor Dower). Commodore Matthew Perry's 1853-54 expedition to force Japan to open its doors to the outside world is an extraordinary moment to look at by examining and comparing the visual representations left to us by both the American and Japanese sides of this encounter. This module also addresses the rapid Westernization undertaken by Japan in the half century following the Perry mission. Module 2: Social Protest in Imperial Japan: The Hibiya Riot of 1905 (Professor Gordon). The dramatic daily reports from participants in the massive "Hibiya Riot" in 1905, the first major social protest in the age of "imperial democracy" in Japan, offer a vivid and fresh perspective on the contentious domestic politics of an emerging imperial power. Module 3: Modernity in Interwar Japan: Shiseido & Consumer Culture (Professors Dower, Gordon, Weisenfeld). Exploring the vast archives of the Shiseido cosmetics company opens a fascinating window on the emergence of consumer culture, modern roles for women, and global cosmopolitanism from the 'teens through the 1920s and even into the era of Japanese militarism and aggression in the 1930s. This module will also tap other Visualizing Cultures units on modernization and modernity. NOTES: UTokyo001x: Visualizing Postwar Tokyo, by University of Tokyo, follows in this series. For MIT students: VJx will be part 21F.027J Visualizing Japan in the Modern World, a residential course taught by Professor Miyagawa, Fall 2014. In addition to MITx and HarvardX, this project is supported by the U.S. Japan Foundation, the University of Tokyo, and the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies, Harvard University.
Intro to Probability - The Science of Uncertainty | MITx on edX | About Video
Introduction to Probability - The Science of Uncertainty An introduction to probabilistic models, including random processes and the basic elements of statistical inference. Register for Introduction to Probability from MIT at http://edx.org/courses. About this Course The world is full of uncertainty: accidents, storms, unruly financial markets, noisy communications. The world is also full of data. Probabilistic modeling and the related field of statistical inference are the keys to analyzing data and making scientifically sound predictions. Probabilistic models use the language of mathematics. But instead of relying on the traditional "theorem - proof" format, we develop the material in an intuitive -- but still rigorous and mathematically precise -- manner. Furthermore, while the applications are multiple and evident, we emphasize the basic concepts and methodologies that are universally applicable. The course covers all of the basic probability concepts, including: - multiple discrete or continuous random variables, expectations, and conditional distributions - laws of large numbers - the main tools of Bayesian inference methods - an introduction to random processes (Poisson processes and Markov chains) The contents of this course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding MIT class (Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability) -- a course that has been offered and continuously refined over more than 50 years. It is a challenging class, but it will enable you to apply the tools of probability theory to real-world applications or your research. Course Staff: John Tsitsiklis John Tsitsiklis is a Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering. He obtained his PhD from MIT and joined the faculty in 1984. His research focuses on the analysis and control of stochastic systems, including applications in various domains, from computer networks to finance. He has been teaching probability for over 15 years. Patrick Jaillet Patrick Jaillet is a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Co-Director of the MIT Operations Research Center. He obtained his PhD in Operations Research at MIT. His research interests deal with optimization and decision making under uncertainty as applied to transportation and the internet economy. Professor Jaillet's teaching includes subjects such as algorithms, optimization, and probability.

MIT OpenCourseWare Press Conference - April 4, 2001
On April 4, 2001, MIT President Charles Vest leads a press conference to announce the establishment of MIT's OpenCourseWare (OCW), the web-based program to provide free access to MIT course content, including lecture notes, problem sets, exams and videos. Vest describes OCW as a "natural marriage of American higher education and the capabilities of the World Wide Web," and a reflection of MIT faculty's "deeply ingrained sense of service" and "incredible idealism." The discussion covers issues of access, costs, copyright, motivations and expectations, and the long-term implications of the project. Other panelists include Prof. Steve Lerman (Chairman of the Faculty), Prof. Hal Abelson (EECS) and Prof. Dick Yue (Associate Dean of Engineering).

Gil Strang's Introduction to Calculus for Highlights for High School
Gil Strang gives an overview of his video series Calculus for MIT's Highlights for High School program. Designed to give an easier introduction to calculus. View the complete course at: http://ocw.mit.edu/highlights-of-calculus License: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA More information at http://ocw.mit.edu/terms More courses at http://ocw.mit.edu Subtitles are provided through the generous assistance of Jimmy Ren.
Big Picture of Calculus
Calculus is about change. One function tells how quickly another function is changing. Professor Strang shows how calculus applies to ordinary life situations, such as: * driving a car * climbing a mountain * growing to full adult height View the complete course at: http://ocw.mit.edu/highlights-of-calculus License: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA More information at http://ocw.mit.edu/terms More courses at http://ocw.mit.edu
Big Picture: Derivatives
Calculus finds the relationship between the distance traveled and the speed - easy for constant speed, not so easy for changing speed. Professor Strang is finding the "rate of change" and the "slope of a curve" and the "derivative of a function."

Max and Min and Second Derivative
At the top and bottom of a curve (Max and Min), the slope is zero. The "second derivative" shows whether the curve is bending down or up. Here is a real-world example of a minimum problem: What route from home to work takes the shortest time?

The Exponential Function
Professor Strang explains how the "magic number e" connects to ordinary things like the interest on a bank account. The graph of y = e^x has the special property that its slope equals its height (it goes up "exponentially fast"!). This is the great function of calculus.

Big Picture: Integrals
The second half of calculus looks for the distance traveled even when the speed is changing. Finding this "integral" is the opposite of finding the derivative. Professor Strang explains how the integral adds up little pieces to recover the total distance. I know the speed at each moment of my trip, so how far did I go?
