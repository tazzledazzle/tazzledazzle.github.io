1. Title and Overview

Project Name: Automated Testing for macOS Applications
Objective:
Implement unit and integration tests for macOS applications using XCTest and other testing frameworks.

2. Goals and Non-Goals

Goals:
	•	Write unit tests for core application logic.
	•	Automate integration tests to verify end-to-end workflows.

Non-Goals:
	•	Replace XCTest with an alternative testing framework.

3. Design Overview
	•	Input: Application source code and test cases.
	•	Output: Automated test scripts and test results.
	•	Architecture:
	•	Unit Tests: Validate individual components.
	•	Integration Tests: Verify interactions between components.

4. System Design
	1.	Write Unit Tests:
	•	Use XCTest to write and execute test cases.
	2.	Set Up CI Integration:
	•	Automate test execution in CI/CD pipelines.
	3.	Validate Results:
	•	Ensure tests pass across multiple macOS versions.

5. Testing Strategy
	•	Write tests for edge cases and common workflows.
	•	Integrate test coverage reports.
