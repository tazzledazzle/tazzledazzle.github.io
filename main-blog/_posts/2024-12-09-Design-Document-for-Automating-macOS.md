# Design Document for Automating macOS Installers (.pkg and .dmg)

## 1. Title and Overview

### Project Name: macOS Installer Automation
### Objective:
Develop a fully automated pipeline for creating .pkg and .dmg installers for macOS applications. The project will also explore the distribution of apps using Homebrew formulas, ensuring compatibility across multiple macOS versions.

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals:
* Automate the creation of .pkg and .dmg installers.
* Ensure installers are compatible with macOS versions like Ventura, Sonoma, and Sequoia.
* Create and publish Homebrew formulas for streamlined app distribution.

### Non-Goals:
* Developing a custom macOS installer tool from scratch.
* Integration with app stores or third-party distribution platforms.

## 3. Design Overview
* Input: Compiled macOS application binary and resources.
* Output:
	* .pkg installer for managed installations.
	* .dmg image for drag-and-drop installations.
	* Homebrew formula for command-line distribution.
* Architecture:
	* Build Automation:
		* Automate the build process using pkgbuild and dmgcanvas.
	* Validation and Testing:
		* Verify installers across multiple macOS versions.
	* Distribution: 
		* Use Homebrew to simplify CLI-based installation.

## 4. System Design

### 4.1 Components
* Installer Builder:
	* Automates the creation of .pkg using pkgbuild and .dmg using dmgcanvas or create-dmg.
* Configuration Manager:
	* Stores metadata like app name, version, package identifier, and installation scripts.
* Validator:
	* Tests installer compatibility and correctness across macOS versions.
* Homebrew Formula Generator:
	* Automates the creation of Homebrew formulas for CLI-based app distribution.

### 4.2 Workflow
1.	Preparation:
	* Collect application binaries, resources, and metadata.
	* Write pre-install and post-install scripts for `.pkg`.
2.	Build Process:
	* Use `pkgbuild` to generate `.pkg` files with necessary permissions and configurations.
	* Use `dmgcanvas` or `create-dmg` to generate `.dmg` images.
3.	Validation:
	* Run installers on different macOS versions to verify compatibility.
	* Automate validation using macOS VMs or CI tools like GitHub Actions.
4.	Homebrew Integration:
	* Generate and publish Homebrew formulas.
5.	Distribution:
	* Host `.pkg`, `.dmg`, and Homebrew formulas on a public or private server.

## 5. API and Data Structures

### 5.1 Configuration File
* `InstallerConfig.json`:
```json
{
    "appName": "SampleApp",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "identifier": "com.sample.app",
    "installScripts": {
        "preInstall": "scripts/preinstall.sh",
        "postInstall": "scripts/postinstall.sh"
    },
    "outputDir": "./dist"
}
```


### 5.2 Interfaces
* `InstallerBuilder`:
```python
def create_pkg(config_file: str) -> str:
    """Generate a .pkg installer based on configuration."""
def create_dmg(config_file: str) -> str:
    """Generate a .dmg installer based on configuration."""
```

* `Validator`:
```python
def validate_installer(installer_path: str, macos_versions: List[str]) -> bool:
    """Validate installer compatibility across macOS versions."""
```

* `Homebrew Formula` Generator:
```python
def generate_formula(config_file: str, repo_url: str) -> str:
    """Create a Homebrew formula for distribution."""
```
## 6. Installer Automation Tools
* `pkgbuild`: Official tool to package software into `.pkg` format.
* dmgcanvas/create-dmg: Utilities for creating `.dmg` images with drag-and-drop interfaces.
* `Homebrew`: Package manager for macOS to distribute applications.

## 7. Multiversion Testing
* Testing Matrix: Validate installers on Ventura, Sonoma, and Sequoia using virtualization or cloud-based CI tools.
* Automated Test Scenarios:
	* Install and uninstall workflows.
	* Compatibility with system preferences (e.g., permissions).
	* Edge cases like corrupted files or missing dependencies.

## 8. Best Practices
* Security: Sign and notarize installers to meet Apple’s security requirements.
* Testing: Test installers on clean macOS installations to simulate real user environments.
* Documentation: Provide clear instructions for both `.pkg` and `.dmg` installations.

## 9. Example Workflow
1.	Prepare Metadata:
	* Create `InstallerConfig.json` with app details.
2.	Automate Build:
	* Run a Python script to execute `pkgbuild` and `dmgcanvas` commands.
3.	Validate:
	* Use a CI tool to run tests on different macOS versions.
4.	Distribute:
	* Upload `.pkg` and `.dmg` to a server.
	* Publish Homebrew formula to a public repository.

## 10. Testing Strategy
###  Unit Testing:
Validate individual scripts (e.g., pre-install scripts).
### Integration Testing:
 Test end-to-end installer generation and installation workflows.
### Performance Testing:
 Measure installer build times for large applications.
