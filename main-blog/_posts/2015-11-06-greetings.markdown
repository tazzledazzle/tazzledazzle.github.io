This is a post holding all of my Algorithms and data structures that potentially can come up on a tech interview. I feel it's a good place to post my knowledge in different OOP languages as well, so that I know that I have a good understanding of most standard libraries.

* Trees
    * manipulation
    * traversal
* hash tables
* stacks
* arrays
* linked lists
* priority queues
* dynamic programming
* famous classes of NP-complete problems
* quick sort
* merge sort
* binary search
* depth first
* breadth first
* combinatorial search
* substring searching
* counting problems
* probability problems
* discrete math 101
* combinatorics
* graphs
    * representations
    * distance
    * search
    * connectivity
    * cycle-detection
    * bfs
    * dfs
* recursive solutions
* concurrent processing
* processes
* threads
* concurrency issues
* locks
* mutexes
* semaphores
* monitors and how they work
* how to avoid:
    * deadlock
    * livelock 
* context switching
* scheduling
* fundamentals of "modern" concurrency constructs
