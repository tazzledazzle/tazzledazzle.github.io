There's nothing here!

I guess you're stuck with the factor that I didn't get a chance to finish this twitter project or any of my research :(

One day I will finish it. But until then, here are a couple of todo items in regards to distributed systems:
* Distributed File System
* Peer to peer file sharing
* instant messager
* Sending data to and from cellular devices and servers
* Protein folding
* Real time game
* Airline reservation System
* Streaming p2p video
* low latency notification system
