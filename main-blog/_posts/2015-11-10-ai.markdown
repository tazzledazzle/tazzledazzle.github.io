agents   
rationality   
observability   


##### properties of task environments
* fully observable vs. partially observable
* single agent vs. multiagent
* Deterministic vs. stochastic
* episodic vs. sequential
* static vs. dynamic
* discrete vs. continuous
* known vs. unknown

The hardest case is partially observable, multiagent, stochastic, sequential, dynamic, continuous, and unknown

##### environment class
...
##### Production Systems
* any system that has conditions that breed resulting state
* 

{% highlight python %}

# basic if [condition] then [action] works for these choices
if input == 'Why?':
	return explain()
elif input == 'So What?':
	return response()

Prolog things:   
{% highlight prolog %}

?- likes(george, susie)
:= X

{% endhighlight %}

These Production Systems can be ordered or unordered. Ordered is a bit harder to be discrete with testing 
and is harder to add/remove rules.
