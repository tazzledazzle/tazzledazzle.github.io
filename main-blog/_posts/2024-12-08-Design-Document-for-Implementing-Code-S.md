# Design Document for Implementing Code Signing and Notarization

1. Title and Overview

Project Name: Code Signing and Notarization for macOS Applications
Objective:
Implement automated workflows for code signing and notarization to ensure macOS app security compliance.

2. Goals and Non-Goals

Goals:
	•	Automate code signing and notarization processes.
	•	Ensure app distribution readiness for the App Store or direct channels.

Non-Goals:
	•	Modify Apple’s notarization workflow.

3. Design Overview
	•	Input: Application binary.
	•	Output: Signed and notarized application.
	•	Architecture:
	•	Signing: Use codesign to sign the app.
	•	Notarization: Submit the app for notarization using Apple’s APIs.

4. System Design
	1.	Automate Signing:
	•	Use codesign with appropriate certificates.
	2.	Submit for Notarization:
	•	Automate notarization with notarytool or xcrun.

5. Testing Strategy
	•	Test on both notarized and unsigned apps.
	•	Validate App Store readiness.
