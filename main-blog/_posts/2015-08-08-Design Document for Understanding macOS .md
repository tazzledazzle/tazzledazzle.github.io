Design Document for Understanding macOS Security Features

1. Title and Overview

Project Name: macOS Security Feature Exploration
Objective:
Learn and implement macOS security features like sandboxing, keychains, and secure storage APIs.

2. Goals and Non-Goals

Goals:
	•	Understand and use macOS security APIs.
	•	Implement secure app storage and sandboxing.

Non-Goals:
	•	Creating a custom security framework.

3. Design Overview
	•	Input: Application requiring secure storage or restricted access.
	•	Output: Secure macOS application.
	•	Architecture:
	•	Sandboxing: Restrict application access to the system.
	•	Secure Storage: Use Keychain APIs for storing sensitive data.

4. System Design
	1.	Enable Sandboxing:
	•	Modify the app’s entitlements to enable sandboxing.
	2.	Use Secure APIs:
	•	Implement Keychain storage for sensitive information.

5. Testing Strategy
	•	Validate sandboxing restrictions.
	•	Test data encryption and access controls.
