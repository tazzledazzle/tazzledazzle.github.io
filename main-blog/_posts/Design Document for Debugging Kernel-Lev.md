## Design Document for Debugging Kernel-Level Interactions

## 1. Title and Overview

Project Name: Kernel-Level Debugging for macOS Applications
Objective:
Debug applications interacting with macOS kernel features using tools like dtruss and Instruments.

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals

* Debug kernel interactions such as file I/O and memory management.
* Optimize system call usage.

### Non-Goals

* Modifying kernel code or developing kernel extensions.

## 3. Design Overview

* Input: Application binary.
* Output: Debug logs and optimized application.

* Architecture:
  * Tracing: Use dtruss to trace system calls.
  * Profiling: Analyze kernel-level performance issues.

## 4. System Design

1. Set Up Debug Tools:

* Configure dtruss and Instruments for kernel tracing.

2. Run Application:

* Trace system calls during execution.

3. Analyze Logs:

* Identify bottlenecks and optimize code.

4. Testing Strategy

* Compare application performance before and after optimizations.
* Validate system call correctness.
