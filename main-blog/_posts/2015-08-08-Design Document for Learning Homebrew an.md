Design Document for Learning Homebrew and CMake for Dependency Management

1. Title and Overview

Project Name: Managing macOS Dependencies with Homebrew and CMake
Objective:
Set up Homebrew for managing project dependencies and use CMake to streamline builds for macOS applications.

2. Goals and Non-Goals

Goals:
	•	Use Homebrew to install and manage dependencies.
	•	Write and test a CMake-based build system for macOS projects.

Non-Goals:
	•	Replacing CMake with a custom build tool.
	•	Covering platforms beyond macOS.

3. Design Overview
	•	Input: Project source code and dependency requirements.
	•	Output: Compiled binaries with managed dependencies.
	•	Architecture:
	•	Dependency Installation: Use Homebrew for libraries like OpenSSL.
	•	Build Management: Use CMake to generate native macOS build files.

4. System Design
	1.	Install Dependencies:
	•	Use brew install for required libraries.
	2.	Write CMakeLists:
	•	Define dependencies and build steps in a CMakeLists.txt file.
	3.	Build and Test:
	•	Use CMake to generate Makefiles and compile the project.

5. Testing Strategy
	•	Verify build reproducibility across different macOS environments.
	•	Ensure all dependencies are correctly linked.
